# Temperature-app
Project 4 for CS441

This app allows the user to convert between fahrenheit and celsius using text fields. When the user inputs one temp, the other temp converts automatically. There is also a slider to adjust the temperature. There is also a button "Show me the weather!" that takes the user to another view controller with an image coresponding to the temperature they selected. "Done" button takes the user to a thank you page.

Day 1: created project and minor tweaks
Day 2: set up the two view controllers with buttons, sliders, and image view
Day 3: made the text view work behind the scenes and made the two text views convert between the two
Day 4: uploaded images and made the code choose a picture according to the temperature
Day 5: got slider to work and affect the text view. Slider can also be affected by manual change in text view.
Day 6: added constraints and made final tweaks 
Day 7: edited readme
